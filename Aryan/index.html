  <a href= "http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Sakata_Gintoki" target="blank">Sakata Gintoki</a> (坂田 銀時, Sakata Gintoki) is the main protagonist of the Gintama series. He is the founder and president of the Yorozuya and as well a highly skilled samurai, having fought in the Joui War in the past. During the war, he became known as the Shiroyasha ("White Demon") due to his powerful swordsmanship and demonic white appearance.</p1>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p1>
  It is unknown where he was born, what happened to his parents and what he was doing before becoming a child scavenger. It is also unknown how long he was doing this. He gained the nickname "Corpse Eating Demon" from the nearby villagers due to being commonly seen wandering in desert battlefields searching corpses for food and weapons to survive. During one search, Gintoki encounters <a href="http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Yoshida_Shouyou" target="blank">Yoshida Shouyou</a> who had heard the rumors about the child and came to investigate it. Taking a liking to Gintoki and seeing himself in the child, Shouyou gave Gintoki his sword and asked him to come. Gintoki became Shouyou's first student on his newly opened school, <a href="http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Shoka_Sonjuku" target="blank">Shoka Sonjuku</a>, where he learned basic swordsmanship and academics. After gathering more students, all mostly poor, the school earns the attention and scrutiny of the wealthier people in the village. They also gained the attention of two military academics students who have become disillusioned with the academy and the people attending it, <a href="http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Katsura_Kotarou" target="blank">Katsura Kotarou</a> and <a href="http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Takasugi_Shinsuke" target="blank">Takasugi Shinsuke</a>. The two were attracted by the school's goal for the children, striving to achieve their own ideal of a samurai while struggling against themselves. The two will later join officially after helping to fend off some officials from trying to arrest Shouyou. Gintoki himself will later earn a rival, Takasugi.</p1>
<h3>Apperance</h3>
<p1>
  Gintoki has a natural perm which causes him no end of distress. His silvery-blue hair is in a perpetually messy state, which is sometimes exaggerated into a frizzy afro when Gintoki's hair is hit by extreme heat. He has indeterminate grey/green (in the manga) or bordeaux-colored (in the anime) "dead fish eyes" (comparison courtesy of <a href="http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Hijikata_Toushirou" target="blank">Hijikata Toushirou</a>), which are called such because they are nearly always half-lidded. 
His standard outfit consists of a white yukata with a blue swirl pattern on the bottom and at the end of the sleeves, worn so that his arm only goes through the left sleeve and the right half droops down over his obi. Over this he wears a black belt buckled so that there is leftover dangling from the buckle, from which his bokutō Lake Toya hangs. Underneath, he wears a black red-lined shirt with a popped collar and black pants. He also wears knee-high black boots, buckled at the top and above his foot, which appear to add about half an inch to his height. It is shown that he has a closet full of replicas of this outfit, so whenever it gets destroyed he can appear in the next episode or chapter with a new one. All in all, his outfit suggests an air of laziness and may be a reflection of Gintoki's own personal sense of style, though it is revealed that his usual attire is actually the school jersey for the Zunborans (episode 292).</p1>
<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>
<p1>
  Gintoki is extremely lazy. He is often seen wearing a dumb expression on his face and spends his days lounging around reading Shounen Jump whilst imparting wise and sage-like advice to his younger employees, even though he doesn't actually know what he's talking about most of the time. Due to his poverty and unwillingness to do mostly anything, he is always behind on his rent and often runs away when Otose, his landlady, comes to collect the payment. He often blows all of his savings on Pachinko and other gambling games, which <a href="http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Shinpachi" target="blank">Shinpachi</a> and <a href="http://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Kagura" target="blank">Kagura</a> often scold him for. However, even though he is lazy, Gintoki is quite dedicated to his job and tries to help people with the best of his abilities (usually in a very strange and twisted way).</p1>
<h3>Strength & Abilities</h3>
<p1>
  Gintoki's feats are very wide, being a veteran in the Joui War. His powerful swordplay and range of abilities gave him the nickname "Shiroyasha" ("white demon"). He is capable of turning the tide of any battle, being called "The Ace" by Katsura and Takasugi. He defeated strong Amanto and killed many high ranking ones, even those who are in legendary status (like enma and ogre). He's also strong enough to defeat opponents considered the strongest in their respective class. However, his biggest weakness is his rage/anger. Despite becoming faster and stronger, he is a berserker whose only goal is to kill his enemy, leading to enemies that are equal or stronger than him to defeat him or hold him off, as was the case with Oboro, Jirochou, and his later interactions with Utsuro.</p1>
